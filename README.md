# Da Burg

Da Burg is an app to add, remove, and try different burgers on a menu.

## Installation

Go to the app on [Heroku](https://peaceful-dusk-21303.herokuapp.com/) to start playing.

## Usage

To add a burger, use the bottom Burger Adder window to type in the name and specify if you have eaten it or not. After, it will go to it's respective location on the page. Uneaten burgers have options to be eaten or to be removed from the menu. Eaten burgers have options to be put back on the menu or to be removed as well.

## Future development
Burger picture for each card (one for eaten, one for uneated), CSS or JS animations, better spacing between page and elements, ability for cards to sit side by side in widescreen.

## Technologies

The CSS framework used to style this page is [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/)
